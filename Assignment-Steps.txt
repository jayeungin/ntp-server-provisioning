1. Use terraform to create a *.micro instance of CentOS 7. (Make sure you stay in free tier so you aren't charged)
- provision-ntp.tf
2. Use terraform to install salt onto the instance
- provision-ntp.tf

* Note all tasks to be done on Centos 7
* Note the rest of the steps are using saltstack
3. Create an ntp state in saltstack which installs the ntp package on the linux instance
- ntp.sls
4. Add the ntp service to your ntp salt state and make sure it is running and enabled.
- ntp.sls
5. Create a salt state which runs ntpdate 0.centos.pool.ntp.org to force a time sync
- ntp.sls
6. Put your ntp Saltstack into a formula
- top.sls & ntp.sls
7. Add an ntp configuration file with ntp servers set by a variable in your salt
- ntp.conf
8. Use pillar for all variables in your ntp salt states
- not sure how to do this
9. Create an orchestration file that installs ntp, initializes using ntpdate, then starts the ntp service
- InstallNTP.sh
10. Have your state from #3 also set a custom grain called ntp_initalized to True
- couldn't figure out how to do this
11. Create a custom execution module to list configured ntp servers
- couldn't figure out how to do this
