1. Use terraform to create a *.micro instance of CentOS 7. (Make sure you stay in free tier so you aren't charged)
2. Use terraform to install salt onto the instance

* Note all tasks to be done on Centos 7
* Note the rest of the steps are using saltstack
3. Create an ntp state in saltstack which installs the ntp package on the linux instance
4. Add the ntp service to your ntp salt state and make sure it is running and enabled.
5. Create a salt state which runs ntpdate 0.centos.pool.ntp.org to force a time sync
6. Put your ntp Saltstack into a formula
7. Add an ntp configuration file with ntp servers set by a variable in your salt
8. Use pillar for all variables in your ntp salt states
9. Create an orchestration file that installs ntp, initializes using ntpdate, then starts the ntp service
10. Have your state from #3 also set a custom grain called ntp_initalized to True
11. Create a custom execution module to list configured ntp servers
